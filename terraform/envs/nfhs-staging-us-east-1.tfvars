# split with token_validation_enabled. Stage stepping up to "log" —
# validator runs the token check on every request but forwards on
# failure (emits a `token_reject reason=<x> mode=log` CloudWatch line),
# so we can see the shape of what would-be-blocked traffic looks like
# without breaking any existing tokenless viewers. Flip to "enforce"
# once the UA allowlist has been seeded and the log signal shows only
# expected clients failing.

# → CloudWatch log — works in log mode. In enforce, blocked viewers get
# HTTP 451 "blackout_dma" with Cache-Control: no-store.
